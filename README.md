# JobNoticesApp
An iOS App written in SwiftUI 

### Introduction
The App is currently still being developed. The goal of the app is to create a notice board and alert cards for users. An admin account will also be added which will allow the admin user to post, edit and delete notices. 

Users viewing the app will be able to create accounts and interact with the cards created by the admin.
